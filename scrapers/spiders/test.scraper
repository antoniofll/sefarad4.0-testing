{"reviews": [{"ratingValue": 5.0, "reviewBody": "My wife and I stayed here for our 10-year anniversary last week. I had originally planned to stay near the airport, but this site heavily encouraged me to switch to a downtown hotel, and I am glad I did! We had a seven-day stay. Others weren't kidding when they said the hotel was in a great location! There were TONS of restaurants and shops nearby. Our room had a beautiful view of downtown and the bay was in the background. I could even see part of the Giants' baseball stadium from where we were. Our room was kinda small, but very clean. The bed was very comfortable, and we slept like babies the whole time! The hotel staff couldn't have been nicer. If there were any flaws, I would say parking was very expensive (I rented a car for two days so we could do outside the city and had to park there), but I get that it's standard in most places. The breakfast buffet was very expensive too, and we never ate at it once although it looked good. There should be special deals where breakfast is included, and you should be allowed to order it through room service if you don't want to leave your room so early in the morning. Some of the other menu options were pretty pricey, too. We ordered dessert twice with room service, and one of them cost $35! It was good, but not worth that price. Overall though, it was a very nice place and I would stay there again.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "J.J.

At checking in they will swipe your credit card like most hotels do,but in this case,you will have parking at 45 dollars a day ( if you have a hire car which is taller than a BMW X3 the vehicle will not fit in the parking lot due the high restrictions) plus 50 dollars per night holding charges,in total 400 dollars (which worked out at \u00a3312). I addressed these charges with reception told them that we had stayed a the Loews Group Hotel,Hilton Group Hotel on the earlier part of our trip and that neither of these hotels put holding charges as extravagant for what is call incidental charges. I had no issue with the parking costs, but the other charges I do not agree with. Like most people on holiday,you only use hotel for sleeping in,so in our case these holding charges where only depriving us of money on our credit card,plus once the the card was swiped for the parking cost it already give the hotel a card for account charges! We were given room 1506 at checking in,which was right beside the elevators. The noise was to much on the first night,to which I complained about first thing on Wednesday morning,we were given a new room which was fine. The hotel was fine overall, allow a bit run down in places, our second room was both cleaner and bigger,reception is very busy,it would seem a lot of aircraft crews use hotel for overnight stop overs. The area in which it is located is fine,but if walking at night can be a bit unsettling due to the number of homeless and drunks in streets. Use number 47 bus,it will take right down to where it is all happening, the stop is just two blocks up from the hotel.

Like any travelers, we did our research into hotels and their locations. We came across this hotel which received good reviews. We booked two rooms for 3 nights each in May. Upon arriving to the front desk to check in, we were advised by the front desk NOT to use street parking and that it was unsafe so we took the hotel parking option which was roughly $50.00 a night.\n\nWe had alot of suitcases with us as we were a family that was travelling for a wedding. We left some suitcases in our rental car that evening as we were switching out some of the clothes that we would not be needing. The next morning when we woke up and were on our way out, we realized that someone had smashed the back window and stolen all of our luggage's that contained our wedding clothes! We went upstairs to the front desk and they gave us the phone to use to call the police and car rental company. I left my 85 year old grand mother, my mother and brother in the lobby. While i was with my husband filing the police paperwork my brother called me to tell me that the hotel was \"comping\" his lunch When i got back i found out that the lunch that they comped was a soup for one person and some crackers with tea. My family was sitting in the lobby (luggageless) for nearly 4 hours! When i got back. the hotel manager asked if i wanted anything to eat and i replied with sure, pizza would be great! He told me that he could offer me a discount of 50% off the pizza!!!!! My husband and i were extremely upset. We asked if they had cameras on the premises and they said they have 52 cameras but NONE in the parking lots.\n\nWhen i got back i spoke to the same manager and asked him if he was really going to charge me $20.00 (with 50% off) for a pizza from his kitchen when his hotel guaranteed my safety however allowed a break in to happen and ontop of that, they have NO SECURITY CAMERAS. He then said that we would remove the parking cost off our bill and that was the best that he could do. We had our car rental broken into, our wedding clothes (worth thousands of dollars) stolen, he gave my family crackers and tea for lunch (3 people!) and then wanted to charge me for a pizza!! unbelievable.\n\nIn times of crisis, you depend on customer service and empathy to make things a bit easier on you. This hotel is definitely not a good place to stay.\n\nI would strongly suggest to NEVER stay at this hotel. Not only was a robbed of our clothes, the parking was unsafe (and the hotel suggested that it was very safe and advised us not to park on the street parking outside) and treated it as if they were doing me a big favour by removing the $50.00 a day parking charge!\n\nDO NOT STAY HERE.....", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "RGJOHAL"}, "@type": "Review", "datePublished": "Reviewed 5 days ago\nNEW"}, {"ratingValue": 3.0, "reviewBody": "Rooms are pretty small, and although we stayed in 15th floor the noise from the street was bothering.

It is pretty sad, not the fault of the hotel but something to be aware of.\n\nThe worst:\nDo not take the Airport Shuttle, we were not told it stopped at four other hotels before heading to the SF airport. It was also expensive compared to Uber or one of the other ride services. We ended up bouncing around in a van with no AC for 45 minutes before even heading to the airport.

There is no dedicated Club Lounge. Technically, I think you are supposed to get a bathrobe, but we did not.\n\nAnyway, the view was really nice. There are windows across one wall of the room, and our room faced toward the Embarcadero side of the city. We could see the cable cars coming up the hill from our room. At night the city lights were even more beautiful.\n\nThe room itself was standard Holiday Inn -- king-size bed (quite comfortable), desk, television, chair, bathroom with shower/bath, etc. It was well-maintained, except for the heat/AC unit, which could have used a paint job. Also, the unit was LOUD -- after the first night, I resorted to earplugs. Street noise was mostly not a problem, since we couldn't hear it over the heating unit.\n\nThe rest of the hotel is all very comfortably, if not glamorously, appointed. There is a restaurant in the hotel that looks to serve good happy hour specials, although we never did stop in for that. We had breakfast there once -- there is a terrific breakfast buffet, but buffet breakfast for two after tax and tip put us around $50.

As I was being brought in as a consultant, I was not paying for my accommodations. They were being fully billed to the company who had brought me to San Francisco. This being said.... I asked that the front desk steward only imprint my card as I would be paying for incidentals with cash. He insisted that they had to take a hold of $150 - which was totally way more than anything I would have spent. He then begrudgingly (after me protesting for a few minutes) agreed to lower it to $100.00. ($50 would have been plenty) I explained that I would not be charging to the card and did not want a large hold on it as that lasts for a minimum of 14 days before it's released. He was less than pleasant about the matter and we left it at that. The morning that I was checking out, I found a cleaning rag half hanging out of my suitcase. I had left my case open (as I had only spare shoes etc in it - anything of value was on my person). It obviously had been gone through and the person must have accidently left the rag behind..... I brought this rag to the front desk and they said that they would speak to the cleaning staff but since nothing was taken, they really could not do much. The manager tried to explain it away by saying maybe the bag had been knocked over and simply replaced to it's position. That really doesn't fly in my book.
